# HOW TO REMEMBER EVERYONE ON SOMETHING LIKE OMEGLE PERFECTLY BUT NOT QUICKLY
Create a struct called user, add whatever data you need manually like I did (RIP lol) or have them enter it. Give whatever user a new prime number and actually contain user data and then use the composite numbers generated as keys to a map. This is how you can remember which users have interacted with which players perfectly. Idk I suck at social interaction. Omegle is a community and not a series of deepfakes trying to talk to you. I want to make a drone that multiple people can control with their voice or their hands.
People judge but maybe if youre making a game don't judge people on real life properties. If you're judging people maybe you're not just playing a game. If you make a game out of social interactions it'll suck because not everything is a game and some code is just algorithms.
This way you can essentially play perfect tournaments with users interacting with random users as long as the number of users is known and how long the tournament will take is known. The proper game size or calculate the number of games in a perfect tournament. This only works in group sizes of 3 right now. Please don't abuse or share user data and try to hash the users identities but dont have the users try to hash it out.
