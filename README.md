# Seperating-kids-from-fighting-in-group-size-N
So I used to teach kids how to swim and I had these 2 kids fighting in a class of kids. The situation is this:

Imagine you have a group sized N of kids that would be lined up against a wall in a swim class youre teaching.
The kids all secretly aggressive towards each other.
I send them in a swimming circuit.
After they are back in the line they begin to fight their 2 direct neighbors and refuse to sit next to the same pair of neighbors on their next swimming lap.
Kids at the front or end of the line only have one neighbor and that is different from having the same neighbor but in a neighbor-pair.
I wonder how many laps the kids can do before a kid just refuses to be next to the same set of kids again and walks out.


Hey if anyone finds like a general equation for what this problem predicts can they let me know. That shit would be useful.
